## Introduction

Website that receives a ```name``` parameter and says hello + the name passed as parameter.

## Installation

To be able to run the web server you must have node.js and npm installed.
To check if you have it installed run:
```
node -v
```
If by running this command it doesn't show you the version number, install it by following the instructions in [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

After having node install
```
npm install
```


## Usage

Now you can start the web server in the terminal using the following command:
```
npm start
```

To see the website in the browser go to ```localhost:8080/```.
